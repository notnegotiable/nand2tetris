Here are my projects as prescribed in Nisan and Schocken's "The Elements of Computing Systems." More info can be found at: http://nand2tetris.org/

The projects vary in scope and complexity, from virtually building hardware like elemetary logic gates to implementing a functional OS. 
In the end, I will have constructed a complete general-purpose computer sytem, essentially from scratch!

- PART 1: HARDWARE
  * Project 01: Boolean Logic
  * Project 02: Boolean Arithmetic
  * Project 03: Sequential Logic
  * Project 04: Machine Language
  * Project 05: Computer Architecture
  * Project 06: Assembler

- PART 2: SOFTWARE
  * Project 07: VMI: Stack Arithmetic
  * Project 08: VMII: Program Control
  * Project 09: High-Level Language
  * Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
  * Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation
  * Project 12: Operating System
